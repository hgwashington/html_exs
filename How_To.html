        <h2>7 Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Managing Expectations</h3>
                <p>Talk to your doctor to make sure breathing is right for you.
                    Certain conditions can make breathing impossible.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Positive Mindset</h3>
                <p>Once you have dicussed your new lifestyle with your healthcare provider, take some time to do things that make you happy.
                     Remember it will be easier for you to commit to the process if you have a positive attitude.

            </li>
            <li><h3>Support System</h3>
                <p>Let your friends and family know that you plan to start breathing. 
                    Express to them that you would like to have their support, going foward. </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Environmental Control</h3>
                <p>Before you begin make sure you are in an environment without airway restiction.
                    Most places should be fine. Try to avoid being underwater or buried alive.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Know your "Why"</h3>
            <p>Keep in mind why you're doing this. Why did you start breathing in the first place?
                Is it because you have to or do you have a greater purpose?
            </p></li> 
            <li><h3>Find your Center</h3>
            <p>Now, that you have your mind right, sit down (or stand).

            </p></li>
